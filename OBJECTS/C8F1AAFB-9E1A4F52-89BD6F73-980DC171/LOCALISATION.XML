He is largely responsible for a recent influx of weapons into the country, in clear violation of the Joint Signatory Framework. His reputation as a dangerous arms dealer is well deserved. Outside of the following facts, little is known about the Jackal- that has only aided him in becoming an almost mythic figure in the region. \n\n* The Jackal is approximately 45-50 years old. \n\n* He has been floating around third world hot spots for the last 20 years. \n\n* According to interviews with journalist Reuben Oluwagembi, the Jackal has built his business conservatively, in increments, by literally buying in bulk guns that were collected during amnesty programs in the wake of peace treaties at the end of one civil war, only to turn around and sell them to guerrilla fighters (or governments) the next country over. \n\n* Contrary to popular myth, the Jackal doesn't mainly resell guns from the former Soviet Union; instead he buys out whole armories from wanting colonial powers or from militaries that have replaced their old ordnance with upgraded gear. \n\n*According to the Jackal, he's been able to conduct his business for years unmolested by the West because he fills a vital niche in the global arms market, offering a layer of deniability in transactions between the big export powers and their impoverished and perpetually war-torn customers in the third world. \n\n* He's relied heavily on accumulating misinformation and hearsay to build up his reputation and keep adversaries and associates alike at a safe distance. \n\n* Beneath the Jackal ""myth"", this unnamed man is a morose, narcissistic, anti-social, misanthropic, impulsive, and generally kind of a drunken bastard. But almost in spite of himself, he seems to have razor-sharp survival instincts that kick in at the last minute no matter how self-destructively he behaves.</LANG>

    <LANG ID="fr-FR">La présence du Chacal contribue à l'instabilité de l'État. Il est en grande partie responsable de l'afflux d'armes dans le pays, violant ouvertement la Convention des Cosignataires. Il mérite amplement sa réputation de marchand d'armes dangereux. Exceptés les faits suivants, les informations au sujet du Chacal restent rares, ce qui contribue à en faire une légende dans la région. \n\n* Le Chacal a environ 45-50 ans. \n\n* Il erre dans les zones les plus dangereuses du Tiers Monde ces 20 dernières années. \n\n* Selon les interviews avec le journaliste Reuben Oluwagembi, le Chacal aurait progressivement monté son affaire. Il achèterait des armes récupérées suite aux traités de paix signés à la fin des guerres civiles. Il les vendrait ensuite aux rebelles (ou au gouvernement) d'un autre pays en guerre. \n\n* Contrairement aux rumeurs locales, les armes que le Chacal revend ne proviennent pas de l'ex Union soviétique. Elles tirent leur origine d'anciennes colonies dans le besoin ou d'armées qui ont remplacé leur matériel obsolète avec de l'équipement de pointe. \n\n*D'après le Chacal, le monde occidental l'a laissé faire parce qu'il occupe un rôle essentiel du marché mondial des armes. Les grandes puissances peuvent le désigner comme bouc émissaire auprès de leurs clients du Tiers Monde qui restent continuellement déchirés par les guerres. \n\n* Sa réputation s'est forgée grâce aux rumeurs et à la désinformation afin de garder ses rivaux et ses alliés à distance. \n\n* Derrière le ""mythe"" du Chacal se cache un homme sans nom, morose, narcissique, asocial, misanthrope, impulsif et violent quand il boit. Malgré cette personnalité auto-destructrice, il possède néanmoins un puissant instinct de survie qui entre toujours en action à la dernière minute.</LANG>
