    <LANG ID="en-GB">Not so much a range of T's as a people-powered gaming movement. This full 26 letter Alphabet T-shirt set (with punctuation marks included) is all about getting together and making a statement (literally). Make the longest word or the weirdest words with your friends. Host your own Alphabet Party. Challenge others to a body based quiz game. All brought to you by individual letters, the hard-working characters behind words.  [#Legal]</LANG>
