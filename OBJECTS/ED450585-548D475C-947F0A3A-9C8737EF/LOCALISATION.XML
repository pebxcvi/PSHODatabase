    <LANG ID="en-GB">Andy Park, the programme director at Radio Clyde in Glasgow (Scotland) claims not only did he design the logo for the station but actually gave the t-shirt to Frank Zappa when he was there for an interview in 1980. Maybe Frank wore the Radio Clyde shirt because they played his music. If so, they were part of the few and the brave among the many who took their advertisers and themselves way too seriously.

    <LANG ID="fr-FR">Andy Park, le directeur des programmes sur Radio Clyde à Glasgow (Écosse) revendique le design du logo de la station radio et il prétend aussi avoir donné le t-shirt à Frank Zappa lors d'une interview dans les locaux en 1980. Frank portait peut-être le t-shirt Radio Clyde parce qu'ils y passaient sa musique. Si tel est le cas, ils faisaient partie des rares courageux à ne pas prendre leurs annonceurs et eux-mêmes beaucoup trop au sérieux. [#Legal]</LANG>

Vielleicht trug Frank das "Radio Clyde"-Shirt, weil der Sender seine Musik spielte. Falls dem so ist, gehörte er zu den wenigen Mutigen unter all jenen, die sich selbst und ihre Werbepartner viel zu ernst nahmen. [#Legal]</LANG>
    <LANG ID="it-IT">Andy Park, direttore della programmazione di Radio Clyde di Glasgow (Scozia), non solo afferma di aver inventato personalmente il logo della stazione, ma anche di aver consegnato la t-shirt a Frank Zappa in occasione di un'intervista nel 1980. Forse Zappa ha indossato la maglietta di Radio Clyde perché mandavano in onda la sua musica. Se così fosse, facevano parte di un nucleo di pochi coraggiosi tra i tanti che prendevano se stessi e i loro inserzionisti troppo sul serio. [#Legal]</LANG>
